# CurryMake
A fun little app listing out some curry recipes to play around with, and using the UIPagedViewController to display the steps in the recipe. 
Swipe through each of the steps to keep track of the cooking steps.


The application asks for a list of recipes from the Firebase database.

Upon clicking an item the ingredients are displayed.

### Work in progress:
1) Getting more recipes on the database.

2) Getting Search View controller work. 

3) Sorting of the Recipe list in a proper way. 

4) Adding some functionality to the stub hamburger button in the navigation bar. (Sharing,etc)
